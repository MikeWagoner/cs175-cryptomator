# Who are the YesMen?
<img align="right" width="30%" border="10px" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V6Bv8AhcYsyl9LQz3cgkhxOGBr1CJtmEBK1rWxUSjkJGALFO98li734EtFPW312M-C_xmkJFvJb1J-NOZnUGcFkUIxkDTPwLzWAjW0EGObLEIk3usC7ittxmzZFjmjgcJBJLeeGrYEo">
- The YesMen aim to draw media attention to issues caused by corporations and government through culture jamming campaigns 
- They create fake websites, fake petitions, performances and films that look legitimate at first glance, but have false information
- These get the public’s attention and reveal the issues and corruption in “corporate takeover” 
- The YesMen consists of two men, Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, but they likely have other members to help carry out their projects --also the YesLab

The YesMen utilize digital media to:
- Empower citizens by raising awareness
- Expose social class inequality
