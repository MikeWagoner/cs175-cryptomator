# Who are the YesMen?
<img align="right" width="30%" border="10px" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V6Bv8AhcYsyl9LQz3cgkhxOGBr1CJtmEBK1rWxUSjkJGALFO98li734EtFPW312M-C_xmkJFvJb1J-NOZnUGcFkUIxkDTPwLzWAjW0EGObLEIk3usC7ittxmzZFjmjgcJBJLeeGrYEo">
- The YesMen aim to draw media attention to issues caused by corporations and government through culture jamming campaigns 
- They create fake websites, fake petitions, performances and films that look legitimate at first glance, but have false information
- These get the public’s attention and reveal the issues and corruption in “corporate takeover” 
- The YesMen consists of two men, Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, but they likely have other members to help carry out their projects --also the YesLab.
   

The YesMen utilize digital media to:

- Empower citizens by raising awareness
- Expose social class inequality

**Homeland Security Congress**
   - In 2014 the YesMen posed as aides to Colin Powell at the Homeland Security Congress.
   - This event is attended by influential politicians, lobbyists, law enforcement officials, and Intelligence Community officers.
   - The YesMen announced a “revolutionary US government plan” to dismantle fossil fuel companies and have the US be running on 100% renewable energy by 2030.

#### National Rifle Association

- The YesMen launched a fake NRA campaign, “Share the Safety” in 2016. 
- The NRA responded with a sweeping DMCA notice to the webhost of the site.
- 38,000 websites, including ShareTheSafety.org were taken down in response.  
- This censorship is possible because of the monetary and political power of the NRA.

The US Chamber of Commerce made these legal Claims against the YesMen:
- Conspiracy
- Cybersquatting
- False Advertising
- Trademark Infringement
- Trademark Dilution

# What is Cryptomator?

### Technical Aspects

- Cryptomator functions as a virtual drive. Files are encrypted and decrypted on the fly with every file access
- 256 bit AES encryption along with a MAC masterkey is used for encryption of files and file authentication 
- WebDAV is the frontend for cryptomator and is an HTTP-based protocol. 

### Masterkey Derivation

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lrdcmBws972rw2kDauSJWIgDiuHpiycYr7-P-J9G3csT7kkhb5K4LUXUErrSvA6ns3XCjkPz6fZm38Kg0UHDsteX77226rKtC8tPHjVKWdQDcgdeTbJU5UcbfBNyeuguAOOYcdIc8Cg" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;">
The KEK decrypts the stored masterkeys when unlocking the vault</div>

Each vault has its own encryption and MAC masterkey. A cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator called SecureRandom with ShA1PRNG is used to seed the key with 440 bits. Afterward, Scrypt encrypts the masterkey with a KEK (Key-encryption key) derived from the user’s password. Scrypt is designed to make large-scale custom hardware attacks costly by requiring large amounts of memory.

### Encryption Process

Files along with folder names are encrypted. The cleartext name of a file is encoded using UTF-8 in Normalization form C for a unique binary representation. AES-SIV is used to encrypt the file and directory names.

## What Cryptomator does for you

Allows you to secure your data on any server or cloud storage including Dropbox and Google drive. This allows for a group to share vaults and keep what they’re working on encrypted. It’s Open source and available on many platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and even as a jar.
And best of all: it is easy to use!
