- The YesMen aim to draw media attention to issues caused by corporations and government through culture jamming campaigns 
- They create fake websites, fake petitions, performances and films that look legitimate at first glance, but have false information
- These get the public’s attention and reveal the issues and corruption in “corporate takeover” 
- The YesMen consists of two men, Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, but they likely have other members to help carry out their projects --also the YesLab

The YesMen utilize digital media to:
- Empower citizens by raising awareness
- Expose social class inequality

### National Rifle Association

- The NRA responded with a sweeping DMCA notice to the webhost of the site.
- 38,000 websites, including ShareTheSafety.org were taken down in response.  
- This censorship is possible because of the monetary and political power of the NRA.
